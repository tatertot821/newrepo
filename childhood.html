<p>Taylor Allison Swift was born on December 13th, 1989 in Reading, Pennsylvania to parents Andrea and Scott Swift. As a child, she had always been interested in moving to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue country music. She constantly wrote songs in her personal diaries about her experiences with bullying at school and other personal matters. Her talent was recognized by her parents, who signed her up to sing the National Anthem at events and brought her to open mic nights at local restauraunts. She taught herself how to play the guitar that she got for Christmas and was constantly writing about her feelings. </p>
